    "A boxplot is a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles. It displays the five-number summary of a set of data, which is the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum. These quartiles are the values that divide a list of numbers into quarters. Boxplots may also have lines extending vertically from the boxes indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles and so can also be called whisker plots. Outliers in relation to these plots refer to an observation that lies abnormal distance from other values in a data sample. This breakdown can be seen on the beliow figure 1."

    "The man responsible for the introduction of box and whisker plots was John Tukey. In the 1970's he introduced these as part of his toolkit for exploratory data analysis. Boxlots are a more compact distributional summary, displaying less detail than a histogram but also taking up less space. Boxplots have become one of the few plot types invented in the 20th century that has found widespread adoption. They are particulary useful for comparing distribution across groups."
